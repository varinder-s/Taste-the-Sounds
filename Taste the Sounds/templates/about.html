        Taste the Sounds is a project created by me, Varinder Singh for CS50x. The idea for this project was given to me by a friend of mine. This endeavor combined multiple technologies 
        learned throughout the course, including Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. Throughout the project, many difficulties and challanges were faced and overcome, but there 
        is much more which I would like to add and improve upon. My journey to computer science has just begun, and I am ready to face the future head on.
